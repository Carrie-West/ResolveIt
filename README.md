### ResolveIt
Personal Project for COP1500


My project revolves around the game: Magic: The Gathering. Declared the most complicated game in the world according to the MIT Technology Review, the game's success seems to rely around its diverse library of abilities and spells. While this makes each game different and intensely fun, it can become difficult to figure out how each spell/ability interacts with one another. This is especially true when referring to the **Stack** (the zone where spells and abilities wait to resolve) as it runs through each ability in a Last-in, First Out format. 
### Goals

-   A program meant to simulate and resolve a stack of abilities within a game of Magic: The Gathering.

### Boundaries / Scope

-   This is not a program meant to emulate Magic: The Gathering, simply a way to resolve a complicated series of cards.

### Success criteria

-   Program is able to track player health and resolution of a stack of Magic cards.
-   Weekly work log with commented file uploads and summaries to demonstrate activity.

### Constraints

-   I will be able to implement basic and incredibly common mechanics and abilities, but will not be able to capture the entire 20,000+ and counting card library in this time period.

### Assumptions

-   I have all required software.
-   I will not be able to put every possible card and ability in only twelve weeks.

### Stakeholders

-   Professor: For Grade
-  	 Fellow Magic Players: For Resolution of Complicated Stacks
